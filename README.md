# Naruto-Platformer-V2

This Project is a second part of my previous project i have made for a course named "Naruto Platformer Demo".
This project is a second version of the Demo, but instead of it being a platformer game, i have changed it into a 
2D fighter game as i am a big fan of fighting games and anime like Naruto.

When you start the game, there is a menu that allows you to change characters and the music of the game, quit and start the game.
WARNING, may lag a bit when the game starts but eventually speeds up when the game carries on.

When attacking, you may see a green block, which is the hitbox for each player.

# Libaries used

Pygame.

# What I Learnt

I have learned to create health bars, change the music, create a menu, 
create a way for two players to fight and gave players an opportunity to switch characters.

# Controls
# Player 1
Movement - Use arrows,
Attack 1 - K,
Attack 2 - N,
Block - L,
Jump - Space

# Player 2
Movement - WASD,
Attack 1 - O,
Attack 2 - P,
Jump - Space,
Fly - Jump and hold L

#Errors to expect
Players may fly off the map, the game may start to lag and once one of the players dies their animation may be different from their death animation.

# What I plan to implement in the future

I plan to update the game by adding more characters, adding more levels and try to create an AI enemy to make the game more exciting for players.
